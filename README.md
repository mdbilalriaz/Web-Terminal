Description of the Given Code:
This code is a simple Library Management System built using Node.js with Express and MongoDB. It defines schemas for Books, Authors, and Borrowers, and includes API routes for managing and interacting with these resources.

Key Components:
Database Connection:

Connects to MongoDB at localhost:27017/LibraryManagement using mongoose.
Schemas:

Author Schema: Defines the structure of authors, including name, email (unique), and phone number. Includes a pre-save middleware to limit the number of books an author can be linked to.
Book Schema: Defines the structure of books with title, author (referenced as an ObjectId), ISBN, available copies, and borrow count. Includes a pre-save middleware to prevent books from being borrowed more than 10 times.
Borrower Schema: Defines the structure of borrowers, including name, borrowed books, and membership type (Standard or Premium). Includes a pre-save middleware to limit the number of books a borrower can borrow based on their membership type.
Routes:

GET Routes: For fetching all or individual records of books, authors, and borrowers.
POST Routes: For creating new records for books, authors, and borrowers. There is also a route for handling the borrowing of books by a borrower.
Borrowing Logic: When a borrower borrows a book, the system checks if the book can still be borrowed (available copies, borrow count), and if successful, updates both the book and borrower records.
Server:

The server listens on port 3000 and uses express.json() to parse incoming JSON requests. The cors() middleware is used to allow cross-origin requests.
Error Handling:

The system catches errors for invalid requests, such as trying to borrow more than 10 books or linking an author to more than 5 books, and sends appropriate error messages.
Summary:
Books, Authors, and Borrowers can be created, fetched, and linked through the provided API routes.
Borrowing Logic ensures that a book canâ€™t be borrowed more than 10 times and prevents exceeding the borrow limits for borrowers based on their membership type.
The server listens on localhost:3000 and is ready to interact with the front end or other services via HTTP requests.
